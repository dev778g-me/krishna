  summary: "I got into coding in September 2024, starting with Flutter. At first, I was just experimenting and learning as I went. The apps I built early on didn’t go far, but they gave me the confidence to keep going. Now, I’m focused on Android development with Kotlin and working on apps that solve real problems and actually make people’s lives a little easier.",
